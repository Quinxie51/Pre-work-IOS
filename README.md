App Idea: LetCode

I want to create a coding app that feels like Duolingo but for learning coding. It would make practicing coding more fun and help people build good habits.

- Step-by-Step Roadmaps:
Users pick a goal (like learning "Arrays" or "System Design"), and the app creates a daily challenge plan to help them improve step by step.
They can solve problems on their computer or directly in the app.

- Funny Reminders:
The app sends funny reminders like, "Hey, don’t let your coding streak break! Let’s finish today’s challenge!"

- Gamification Features:
Completing challenges earns points that can unlock fun rewards like cool avatars or hints for harder problems.
You level up as you progress, and streaks give extra motivation to stay consistent.

- Compete and Share:

Users can challenge friends to quick coding matches or see who’s on top of the leaderboard.
